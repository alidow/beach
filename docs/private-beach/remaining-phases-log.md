# Remaining Phases Execution Log

> Running notes while delivering milestones defined in `docs/private-beach/remaining-phases-plan.md`.  
> Keep entries chronological with date + author; capture decisions, verification steps, and outstanding risks.

## 2025-06-19 — Kickoff (Codex)

### Milestone M1 — Surfer UX Foundations
- [x] Draft UX kickoff brief:
  - Outline IA/navigation assumptions, component system targets, accessibility/performance acceptance bars.
  - Identify existing Surfer components that become shared primitives.
- [x] Create tracking issue list for design system + auth migration work (`docs/private-beach/ux-foundation-issues.md`).
- [ ] Document verification plan (axe-core/lighthouse runs) once implementation begins.

### Milestone M2 — Orchestration Mechanics (Fast-Path Prototype)
- [x] Survey current `beach-buggy` capabilities and identify integration points for fast-path data channels.
- [x] Add harness-side fast-path client scaffold (WebRTC negotiation + channel handlers).
- [x] Implement initial handshake: harness fast-path client now negotiates SDP/ICE and exposes action broadcast + ack/state send helpers.
- [ ] Capture validation approach:
  - Unit tests with mocked data channel.
  - Manual recipe aligning with STATUS “Manual Fast-Path Test”.

### Cross-Cutting
- [x] Update `docs/private-beach/STATUS.md` once initial scaffolding lands.
- [ ] Ensure new work references environment variables for TURN/STUN configuration.
