| solution-20251128-ack-stall-rtc-logging.md | solution-20251128-pong-stack-ack-stall-and-turn.md | I chose `solution-20251128-ack-stall-rtc-logging.md` because among the solutions I didn’t author it focuses most directly on the actual root cause: manager↔host controller ack bookkeeping and stall detection, with clear per-action send/ack logging and stall context. It avoids over-attributing the problem to TURN and correctly treats manager↔host as a logic issue on top of an already healthy Docker-network WebRTC path. It also lays out concrete instrumentation that will either prove missing acks or miscounted acks in the next run. | I would explicitly note that TURN/env fixes are only needed for browser↔host and not for manager↔host, to prevent future confusion. I’d also borrow two ideas from my own solution: a simple browser-free Pong RTC smoke harness (using `./scripts/dockerup` + `pong-stack.sh` + ball-trace JSONL to validate volleys) and a brief experiment matrix describing how to stress and validate the updated stall logic under delayed acks and idle periods. |
| solution-20251128-pong-stack-ack-stall-and-turn.md | 20251128-webrtc-fallback-plan.md | Among solutions I didn’t author, this one best balances TURN/env fixes with the ack-stall handling we’re actually seeing, and ties both browser↔host and manager↔host behaviors together. It prescribes concrete logging for send/ack lifecycles and stall context, which we need to prove or disprove the forwarder’s readiness logic. | Add a fail-fast guard when TURN URLs are set but `BEACH_TURN_EXTERNAL_IP` is missing, and log selected ICE pairs at rtc_ready flips. Include the proposed browser-free RTC smoke harness (dockerup + pong-stack + ball JSON check) to validate stability without a browser. |
| solution-2025-11-28-webrtc-fallback-solution.md | solution-20251128-webrtc-fallback-bridge.md | I’m not voting for my own; among the others, the 2025-11-28 webrtc-fallback solution is concise and focuses on actionable fixes for the ack-stall while acknowledging manager↔host is already healthy. It keeps the scope tight on controller flow and logging, which aligns with the current evidence. | I would add explicit ICE pair logging at rtc_ready transitions and the browser-free pong smoke harness (dockerup + pong-stack + ball-trace check) to validate controller flow without a browser. Also clarify TURN is only for browser↔host, not intra-Docker manager↔host. |
| solution-20251128-pong-stack-ack-stall-and-turn.md | solution-20251128-ack-stall-rtc-logging.md | Best non-mine blend of TURN/env fixes plus ack-stall handling; it ties browser and manager paths together and prescribes useful logging. It’s closest to what we need without me voting for my own doc. | Add explicit per-action send/ack logs with stall payload (inflight_by_transport, last_ack age/transport, buffered_amount, ICE/DC state), allow RTC re-promotion after recovery, and include a browser-free smoke harness (dockerup + pong-stack + ball/paddle history check) to verify single-ball volley across hosts. |
