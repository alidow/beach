# WebRTC Implementation Status - Claude Code Session

Status: **Partially Implemented - Not Yet Functional**  
Date: 2025-09-09  
Session: Claude Code Implementation Review

## Executive Summary

WebRTC transport has been partially implemented but is **not yet establishing peer-to-peer connections**. While the signaling infrastructure exists and the offer/answer flow has been corrected, the actual WebRTC data channel establishment fails to complete. Data continues to flow through WebSocket fallback, preventing true P2P communication.

## What Was Attempted

### 1. Fixed Client Answerer Path ✅
**Problem**: Client was incorrectly initiating WebRTC as answerer immediately upon `JoinSuccess`.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `apps/beach/src/session/mod.rs` (lines 345-356, 390-445)
- Client now waits for server's `Offer` signal before initiating as answerer
- On `JoinSuccess`: Only prepares `RemoteSignalingChannel`
- On `ServerMessage::Signal` with `WebRTCSignal::Offer`: Initiates WebRTC answerer

### 2. Added Strict WebRTC Mode ✅
**Environment Variable**: `BEACH_STRICT_WEBRTC=1`

**Files Modified**:
- `apps/beach/src/session/mod.rs`: Added strict mode checks in `send_to_client` and `send_to_server`
- `apps/beach/src/subscription/manager.rs`: Added strict mode check for transport.send()

**Behavior**: When enabled, panics with helpful error messages if WebRTC fails instead of falling back to WebSocket.

### 3. Added Timeouts with Helpful Errors ✅
**Implementation**:
- 30-second timeout for WebRTC handshake (both server and client)
- Wrapped `initiate_webrtc_with_signaling` calls in `tokio::time::timeout`
- Added specific error messages for timeout vs connection failure

**Error Messages**:
```rust
// On timeout:
"WebRTC handshake timed out. This may indicate: 
1) Network firewall blocking WebRTC, 
2) Client/Server not responding, 
3) STUN/TURN servers unreachable"

// On connection failure:
"WebRTC connection required but failed: {}. 
Ensure both peers support WebRTC and network allows peer-to-peer connections."
```

### 4. Fixed Debug Logging ✅
**Problem**: `eprintln!` statements violated CLAUDE.md guidelines (corrupts terminal UI)

**Solution**:
- Removed all `eprintln!` from session module
- WebRTC transport already uses file-based `webrtc_log!` macro
- Debug output now only goes to file specified by `--debug-log` flag

## Current Architecture

### Transport Layer Hierarchy
```
Transport (trait)
├── WebSocketTransport (working - used as fallback)
├── WebRTCTransport (partially implemented)
│   ├── initiate_webrtc_with_signaling() 
│   ├── is_webrtc() -> true
│   └── Uses RemoteSignalingChannel for signaling
└── MockTransport (for testing)
```

### Signaling Flow (Via WebSocket/beach-road)
```
1. Server: PeerJoined event → Initiates as offerer
2. Server: Creates Offer → Sends via SignalingTransport
3. Client: Receives Offer → Initiates as answerer  
4. Client: Creates Answer → Sends back
5. Both: Exchange ICE candidates
6. Both: Should establish P2P connection (FAILS HERE)
```

### Key Files and Their Roles

**Transport Implementation**:
- `apps/beach/src/transport/webrtc/mod.rs` - Main WebRTC transport
- `apps/beach/src/transport/webrtc/remote_signaling.rs` - Signaling channel adapter
- `apps/beach/src/transport/webrtc/config.rs` - STUN/TURN configuration

**Session Management**:
- `apps/beach/src/session/mod.rs` - ServerSession/ClientSession with WebRTC initiation
- `apps/beach/src/session/signaling_transport.rs` - WebSocket signaling bridge

**Protocol**:
- `apps/beach/src/protocol/signaling/mod.rs` - TransportSignal, WebRTCSignal enums

## Why WebRTC Isn't Working Yet

### 1. Data Channels Not Establishing
Despite offer/answer exchange, the actual WebRTC data channels don't open. Possible causes:
- ICE candidates not being properly exchanged or processed
- STUN/TURN server configuration issues
- Firewall/NAT traversal problems
- Timing issues in the handshake sequence

### 2. No Actual Data Channel Usage
Even if WebRTC connects, the implementation doesn't route application data through WebRTC:
- `send_to_client`/`send_to_server` still use WebSocket for app messages
- No integration between WebRTC data channels and Transport::send/recv
- Channel mapping (Control/Output) exists but isn't wired end-to-end

### 3. Missing Client-Side Timeouts
After sending `Subscribe`, client waits indefinitely for `SubscriptionAck`/`Snapshot`. No timeout mechanism to detect when WebRTC fails to deliver these messages.

### 4. Incomplete Multi-Channel Support
While APIs exist for multiple channels (Control/Output), the receiving side doesn't properly map incoming channels by label, preventing dual-channel routing.

## Test Results

### With Strict Mode Disabled (Default)
- ✅ WebSocket signaling works
- ✅ Session establishment works
- ✅ Data flows via WebSocket fallback
- ❌ WebRTC never actually used for data

### With Strict Mode Enabled (`BEACH_STRICT_WEBRTC=1`)
- ✅ Compilation succeeds
- ❌ Client fails with "Device not configured" error (terminal issue)
- ❌ WebRTC connection doesn't establish before timeout
- ❌ No actual P2P data transfer

## Debug Logs Observed

**Server Log** (`/tmp/beach-strict-server.log`):
```
[12:51:57.390] TerminalServer::new failed to detect terminal size, using defaults
[12:51:57.406] Server::start executing command: ["bash"]
```
No WebRTC-specific logs appear, suggesting WebRTC initiation may not be triggered.

**Client Log**: Not created due to early terminal configuration failure.

## Next Steps Required

### Phase A: Stabilize Single-Channel WebRTC

1. **Fix WebRTC Data Channel Establishment**
   - Add more verbose logging to ICE candidate exchange
   - Verify STUN server connectivity
   - Test with localhost-only configuration (no STUN)
   - Add state change callbacks for debugging

2. **Wire Data Channels to Transport**
   - Implement actual send via data channel in WebRTCTransport
   - Route received data channel messages to Transport::recv()
   - Remove WebSocket fallback for data (keep for signaling only)

3. **Add Client Timeouts**
   - After sending Subscribe, timeout waiting for Ack (3s)
   - After Ack, timeout waiting for Snapshot (3s)
   - Provide actionable error messages

4. **Fix Terminal Configuration Issue**
   - Debug why client fails with "Device not configured" in strict mode
   - May need to handle stdin/stdout differently when testing

### Phase B: Implement Dual-Channel Support

5. **Create Named Channels**
   - Control: `beach/ctrl/1` (reliable, ordered)
   - Output: `beach/term/1` (unreliable, unordered)

6. **Route by Message Type**
   - Control: Protocol messages, input, resize
   - Output: Snapshots, deltas

## How to Test

```bash
# Start signaling server
cargo run -p beach-road

# Start server with debug logging
BEACH_STRICT_WEBRTC=1 BEACH_VERBOSE=1 BEACH_DEBUG_LOG=1 \
  cargo run --bin beach -- --debug-log /tmp/server.log -- bash

# Start client with debug logging  
BEACH_STRICT_WEBRTC=1 BEACH_VERBOSE=1 BEACH_DEBUG_LOG=1 \
  cargo run --bin beach -- --debug-log /tmp/client.log \
  --join localhost:8080/SESSION_ID

# Check logs for WebRTC handshake
tail -f /tmp/server.log /tmp/client.log
```

## Key Insights for Next Implementer

1. **WebRTC transport exists but doesn't actually transport data** - It's initialized but never used for application messages.

2. **Signaling works** - Offer/Answer/ICE messages flow correctly through beach-road WebSocket relay.

3. **Transport trait has WebRTC hooks** - `initiate_webrtc_with_signaling()` and `is_webrtc()` are implemented.

4. **Client answerer timing is fixed** - No longer initiates prematurely on JoinSuccess.

5. **Strict mode exists but isn't fully enforced** - Need to actually prevent WebSocket data fallback.

6. **Debug logging is file-based** - Use `--debug-log` flag, never eprintln! (corrupts TUI).

## Summary

WebRTC implementation is structurally in place but functionally incomplete. The main blocking issue is that WebRTC data channels don't establish, causing all data to flow through WebSocket. The offer/answer flow has been fixed, strict mode has been added, and timeouts are in place, but the actual P2P connection establishment fails. The next implementer should focus on debugging why data channels don't open and wiring them to the Transport trait's send/recv methods.
